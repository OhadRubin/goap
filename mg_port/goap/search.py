# 📁 goap/search.py

## Purpose
Contains the PURE, LOW-LEVEL A* SEARCH ALGORITHM. This file is responsible for finding the cheapest path from a start state to a goal state within the graph defined by the graph module. It implements the algorithmic core of GOAP planning.

## Conceptual Overview
The search module implements the A* pathfinding algorithm adapted for GOAP's state-space search. Unlike traditional pathfinding on a grid, this searches through abstract world states, but the algorithm remains fundamentally the same:
- Start at the initial state
- Explore successors prioritized by f-score (g + h)
- Track the cheapest path to each state
- Stop when a goal state is reached

The module knows about:
- How to search (A* algorithm mechanics)
- How to estimate distance (heuristics)
- How to track paths (parent pointers)

The module does NOT know about:
- What actions mean (just that they connect states)
- How states transition (delegates to graph module)
- Why we're searching (goals are just satisfaction functions)

## Design Rationale
- **Why A***: A* is optimal and complete when the heuristic is admissible. It finds the cheapest plan while exploring fewer states than uninformed search.
- **Why separate heuristics by goal type**: Different goal types need different distance estimates. Separating this logic keeps it maintainable.
- **Why private node class**: The search node is an implementation detail that shouldn't leak to other modules. It's specifically designed for the needs of A*.
- **Why path reconstruction**: Working backwards from the goal ensures we return the actual path taken, not just the cost.

## Dependencies
- **Imports**: `heapq` for priority queue implementation
- **Used by**: `planner.py` (calls astar_pathfind for each goal)
- **Uses**: `graph.py` (calls get_successors), `goal.py` (calls is_satisfied)

## Implementation Structure

### Classes

```
class _SearchNode                               (lines 15-35)
```

Private helper class that represents a node in the search tree. Stores:
- `state`: The world state dictionary at this node
- `action`: The action that led to this state (None for start)
- `parent`: Reference to parent node for path reconstruction
- `g_score`: Actual cost from start to this node
- `h_score`: Heuristic estimate from this node to goal

```
def __lt__(self, other) -> bool                (lines 31-35)
```
Implements less-than comparison based on f-score (g + h). This allows SearchNode objects to be used directly in Python's heapq, which maintains a min-heap based on this comparison.

### Helper Functions

```
def _reconstruct_path(                          (lines 38-50)
    end_node: _SearchNode) -> list[Action]
```

Private helper that builds the final plan by tracing parent pointers from the goal node back to the start. Returns the list of actions in forward order (start to goal).

```
def _calculate_heuristic(                       (lines 53-95)
    state: dict, 
    goal: BaseGoal) -> float
```

Private helper that estimates the "distance" from a state to a goal. Implements different strategies based on goal type:
- **Goal**: Count of unmet conditions
- **ComparativeGoal**: Sum of numeric distances to thresholds
- **ExtremeGoal**: Distance from current value to optimization direction

The heuristic must be admissible (never overestimate) for A* to guarantee optimal plans.

### Main Function

```
def astar_pathfind(                             (lines 98-190)
    start_state: dict, 
    goal: BaseGoal, 
    concrete_actions: list[Action]) -> list[Action] | None
```

The main A* implementation. The algorithm proceeds in phases:

1. **Initialization** (lines 105-120)
   - Create start node with g=0 and h=heuristic
   - Initialize open set (heapq) with start node
   - Initialize closed set (set) for visited states
   - Create g_score tracking dictionary

2. **Main Search Loop** (lines 122-180)
   - Pop lowest f-score node from open set
   - Check if goal is satisfied - if so, reconstruct and return path
   - Add current state to closed set
   - Get all successors via graph module
   - For each successor:
     - Skip if already visited (in closed set)
     - Calculate tentative g-score
     - If better path found, update or add to open set

3. **Failure Case** (lines 182-190)
   - Return None if open set empty (no path exists)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Immutable State Tracking**: States are used as dictionary keys, so they must be immutable (converted to frozen representations).

2. **Lazy Successor Evaluation**: Successors are only generated when a node is explored, not when it's discovered.

3. **Single Goal Focus**: The search handles one goal at a time. Multi-goal optimization is the planner's responsibility.

4. **Null on Failure**: Returns None when no path exists rather than raising an exception, allowing the planner to try other goals.

5. **Admissible Heuristics**: All heuristic implementations are designed to be admissible, ensuring optimal plans.

## Performance Characteristics

- Time complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth
- Space complexity: O(b^d) for storing open and closed sets
- Optimality: Guaranteed when heuristic is admissible
- Completeness: Will find a solution if one exists

## Relationship to C# Original

This file consolidates concepts from:
- `MountainGoap/Internals/ActionAStar.cs` - Main A* implementation
- `MountainGoap/Internals/ActionNode.cs` - Search node structure
- Heuristic calculations scattered in the C# code

The Python version benefits from:
- Using heapq instead of custom priority queue
- Cleaner heuristic organization
- More Pythonic state management
