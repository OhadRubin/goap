Sensors deposit perceptions in working memory and the planner uses these perceptions to guide its decision-making. A WorkingMemoryFact is a record containing a set of associated attributes. Different subsets of attributes are assigned depending on the type of knowledge the fact represents.”',\n",
       " 'HOW REFERENCES WORK (EffectReference, reference(..))  \\n“References allow you to ‘pass forward’ an effect from one action into the preconditions of subsequent actions, even if the actual value is only determined at runtime. This is done via class EffectReference: A small class that annotates a requested effect name—and def reference(name: str): A convenience function that returns an EffectReference referencing that name.”\\n“For instance, if Action A has effects = { \"tool_id\": ... }, it means ‘I will provide a tool_id (but we’ll only know the real value at runtime).’ Another action B can specify preconditions = { \"required_tool_id\": reference(\"tool_id\") }, meaning ‘I depend on the tool_id that was created or identified by the earlier action.’”',\n",
