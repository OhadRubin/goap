Looking at the listed activities, I notice several common denominators:

1. **Decision-making** - All these actions require making choices between different options, often with constraints.

2. **Resource management** - Most of these activities involve managing limited resources (time, money, space, attention).

3. **Planning and sequencing** - These actions require thinking ahead, organizing steps in a logical order.

4. **Mental modeling** - Each activity involves creating and manipulating mental models of situations.

5. **Information processing** - All require taking in, processing, and acting on information.

6. **Prioritization** - These tasks involve ranking competing needs or goals.

7. **Cognitive load management** - Each requires balancing multiple considerations simultaneously.

8. **Self-regulation** - These activities require monitoring one's progress and adjusting behavior accordingly.

The strongest common denominator appears to be **executive function** - these are all activities that engage our brain's executive control systems for planning, decision-making, error correction, and navigating complex social or practical problems. Each requires some combination of working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility.
You've made an excellent point - these are all tasks that ordinary people routinely handle in everyday life. The common denominator is indeed that these are:

**Everyday activities that typical adults are expected to manage independently**

These tasks share several characteristics:
- They're common responsibilities in adult life
- Most people learn to do them through normal development and experience
- Society generally assumes competence in these areas
- They don't require specialized expertise or exceptional abilities
- They're part of functional independence in modern society

This perspective highlights how much cognitive work is embedded in "ordinary" tasks that people navigate regularly without special recognition. These activities represent the invisible mental load of everyday adult functioning that most people handle as a matter of course.
